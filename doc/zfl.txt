NAME
----
zfl - ZeroMQ Function Library


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <zfl.h>*

*cc* ['flags'] 'files' *-lzfl* ['libraries']


DESCRIPTION
-----------

ZFL is the ZeroMQ Function Library, a thin portability & function library
for ZeroMQ applications in C/C++.  It is written in clear and readable C,
portable to all ZeroMQ platforms, and licensed under the LGPL.

The goals of this library are to:

* Provide a home for reusable functionality that is of use to ZeroMQ
  application developers working in C/C++.

* Make it easier to write 100% portable applications by abstracting the
  relevant differences between different operating systems.

ZFL is inspired by the iMatix Standard Function Library (SFL), and borrows
liberally from it.  See http://legacy.imatix.com/html/sfl/.


Base Classes

ERROR HANDLING
--------------

Functions that create or search objects return object references success and
NULL on failure.  Functions that perform work return 0 on success and -1 on
failure.  Errors are reported to the 0MQ inproc://zfl_log socket. See
linkzfl:zfl_log[7].


LANGUAGE BINDINGS
-----------------

The ZFL library provides interfaces suitable for calling from programs in any
language; this documentation documents those interfaces as they would be used
by C programmers.
