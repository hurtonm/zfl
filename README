Welcome
-------

ZFL is the ZeroMQ Function Library, a thin portability & function library
for ZeroMQ applications in C/C++.  It is written in clear and readable C,
portable to all ZeroMQ platforms, and licensed under the LGPL.

The goals of this library are to:

* Provide a home for reusable functionality that is of use to ZeroMQ
  application developers working in C/C++.

* Make it easier to write 100% portable applications by abstracting the
  relevant differences between different operating systems.

ZFL is inspired by the iMatix Standard Function Library (SFL), and borrows
liberally from it.  See http://legacy.imatix.com/html/sfl/.

Building and installation
-------------------------

See the INSTALL file included with the distribution.  To build from git,
run sh autogen.sh and then follow the standard INSTALL instructions.  You
will need the pkg-config, libtool, and autoreconf packages.

Using ZFL
---------

Include "zfl.h" in your application and link with libzfl.  The single header
includes the system header files that typical ZeroMQ applications will need.
The provided 'c' shell script lets you write simple portable build scripts.
